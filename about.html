            <b>Audience:</b> Georgia Tech students entering college or recently enrolled who enjoy music or the humanities<br>
            <b>Goal:</b> Curate podcast information of episodes that students can explore as if they were strolling through a library<br>
            <b>Implementation:</b> We aim to display episode information laterally based on keywords in the title or relevance by number of downloads or other metrics. We donâ€™t want people to try and navigate or search, we want them to listen and see, as if they were actually wandering through a physical space
